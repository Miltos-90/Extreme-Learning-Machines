# A Matlab implementation of "Extreme Learning Machine: Theory and Applications"

The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a learning algorithm that first
appeared in [Guang-Bin Huang, Qin-Yu Zhu, Chee-Kheong Siew. \"Extreme
learning machine: Theory and applications\", Neurocomputing (70), pp.
489 - 501,
2006](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/egbhuang/pdf/ELM-NC-2006.pdf) for
single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks, which randomly chooses
hidden nodes and analytically determines the output weights of the
neural network. It has been reported to show good generalization
performance at extremely fast learning speeds. Here, we implement the
training algorithm as presented in the above paper, and also try it on
one of the referenced datasets.

The full code and all outputs can be found in the ELM.pdf file
